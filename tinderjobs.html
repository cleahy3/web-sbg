				<h2> Additional Information</h2>
				<p>Additional to the information given above, I have learned a few particular languages throughout my time at university, the primary one I have used is
				c#. I have also had quite a lot of experience using SQL, GIT, HTML, CSS , PHP , Javascript and more. Aside from my time at university I have worked as an
				assistant manager at a paintball site, managing teams of up to 30 staff and then hundreds of customers daily. I also believe that I work well as a team
				as every employment environment I have worked in to-date has been very team oriented, meaning that I have plenty of experience working with others. I have
				also worked as a sales advisor at PcWorld, advising customers on their purchases and through this I gained experience in sales, aswell as in cash handling and customer service. </p>
